# Marine Diatoms Modeling using K-Means Clustering with Data Analysis

Purpose of Project: To utilize K Means clustering to group data based on similarities, determine the best number of clusters, normalize our data, and conduct data analysis. 

The data I used was from a paper on biofilm formation on [diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassiosira_pseudonana).

Marine diatoms are a proxy for the effects of climate change on the oceans as they are [sensitive to changes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0557-y). They are also a foundation of the oceans food web. Therefore, understanding how diatoms adapt to increased ocean temperatures and acidification is imperitive to predict climate change's future effects.

Diatoms also have a resident microbiota of bacteria, which may confer protections and vital nutrients that help with adaptations under duress. The paper we will be studying has carried out a 400-generation selection for bacterial biofilm formation on the diatoms in several conditions. Using their data, we will rediscover several properties about how diatoms and biofilms react to stressors.

Purpose of Project: To utilize K Means clustering to group data based on similarities, determine the best number of clusters, normalize our data, and conduct data analysis.
